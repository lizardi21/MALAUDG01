                        <p>Within the student field, I've worked on different projects, however, I do not think all of them are remarkable. Except, for some as: a desktop application in C ++ with Qt over a social network of books; website for the development of curribulum directed towards teachers; website for the development of annual plans for university professors, in addition, of the administration of the directors or heads of division; mini projects of creation of mobile applications with AR.</p>

                            I've used Qt Creator for C ++ and Ionic for apps.
                            
                            In work experience, I'm oriented to JS. I'm currently using Ionic for the development of mobile apps. Although, I've also given contributions with pure JS. And, more than front end, with HTML and CSS.
